# 433 Mhz (and 315 Mhz) Modules
We used [these](https://www.amazon.com/UCEC-XY-MK-5V-Transmitter-Receiver-Raspberry/dp/B017AYH5G0/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MDRJEGJM7CT7&keywords=433mhz+transmitter+and+receiver&qid=1562610321&s=gateway&sprefix=433+mhz+%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1) cheap 433 Mhz Tx/Rx modules from Amazon for our tests. We also used [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07415XCSD/ref=sspa_dk_detail_5?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07415XCSD&pd_rd_w=C7678&pf_rd_p=8a8f3917-7900-4ce8-ad90-adf0d53c0985&pd_rd_wg=tGT7p&pf_rd_r=HE2SKCKS4E3B5BCJ2210&pd_rd_r=41d57291-f429-4f40-a710-dcc807e19f55&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLMERUQ0Y0NktFNSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTA0MTY3MzE3NEpHSlQ3UU83WkQmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMTAyMTk0ODhQVk1SSlc2S1Q2UyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) 315 Mhz modules as well, which are pin/code compatible with the 433 Mhz modules. While these modules are very cheap, they also aren't very reliable (especially on the AtTiny85, where the RadioHead library doesn't seem to work), are very slow (the Manchester Encoding library is limited to about 300 baud on the AtTiny85 at 1 Mhz), and have almost no documentation available for them. They also didn't transmit very far from the sweet potato containers: we were able to get 8 feet of range when the transmitter was under about a one-foot-pile of sweet potatoes.

The code included here utilizes modified example code/header files from the [Manchester Encoding library](https://github.com/mchr3k/arduino-libs-manchester), the [BME280 I2C library](https://www.14core.com/wiring-the-bme280-environmental-sensor-using-i2cspi-interface-with-microcontroller/), and the [TinySnore Library](https://github.com/connornishijima/TinySnore).

Note that this code no longer needs to be used in this non-commercial research project and it is included solely for the purposes of thorough prototype documentation as opposed to distribution.
