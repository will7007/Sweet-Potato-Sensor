# Sweet Potato Sensor

When stored and cured, sweet potatoes need to be kept at a certain temperature and humidity level to ensure that they don't go bad.
Traditionally, sweet potatoes have had their temperature and humidity monitored via sensors that reside outside of the crates in which the potatoes are stored in, but wouldn't it be great if you could monitor the temperature and humidity levels within the storage crates? This sounds simple enough, but there's a catch--raw sweet potatoes have lots of water in them, and high-frequency RF transmitters (like a Bluetooth module) won't transmit very far at all. 

That's why this project aims to use cheap 433Mhz RF modules, a BME280 (for sensing), and an AtTiny85 to form a network of low-power temperature and humidity sensors to monitor the temperature and humidity within sweet potato storage crates.

This project is still in progress--I aim on finishing it by the end of summer, as I am developing the sensor as part of an internship at NC State University.
