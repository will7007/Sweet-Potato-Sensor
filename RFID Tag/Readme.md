# NFC Tag

We're no longer considering the use of a high-frequency NFC tag with the sweet potato temperature/humidity sensor, due to a number of factors: strictly directional antennas an a lack of sensor-to-sensor communicator being primary faults with NFC. Since I did a little work with the SV25DV tag, I decided to include what I wrote here, including code for the correct entry of the default password.

I hereby wave my copyright to the little bit of code that I wrote here, so you may use/modify it for any purpose.
