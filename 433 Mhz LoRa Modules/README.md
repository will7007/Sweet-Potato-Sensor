# About This Code

The code included in this folder is a modified version of the example code from the arduino-LoRa library by Sandeep Mistry (see license). Sandeep's library was the only one that I could find which worked with both the AtTiny85 and Adafruit's RFM96W Breakout Board out of the box (link: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3073).

These LoRa modules worked significantly better than the 433/315 Mhz modules in line-of-sight and open-air tests, as expected--after all, they are significantly more expensive. However, they also performed much better from beneath two feet of sweet potatoes, which provided assurance that 433 Mhz would be the right frequency for transmitting from vegetables: off-the-shelf Bluetooth sensors weren't able to transmit at all from under just a few sweet potatoes. While these modules may be the clear choice for vegetable telemetry, please keep in mind that you must have at least a technician-class amateur radio license to be able to transmit anything (such as the one-way telemetry transmissions in this code) on the UHF 433 Mhz band.
